# Basic Web Programming
Simple project utilizing frontend technologies, using HTML5, CSS, and (vanilla) Javascript. Basic utilization of CSS responsiveness for page fitting and Javascript for interactive pages.

# Basic Colour change
On click of the COLOURS button, we have a simple javascript function which changes all the specified colours.

# Register/Login
These pages are not connected to a server, therefore, we cannot login in per se however, it will be updated soon. Register simply allows for the request to be sent over the server in when all required fields are filled.


# Note:
All links except for Login and Register go to *random* places, as per project requirement. Pages are interactive but are run locally. No server connection yet.
